Here you can find a description of the demo application delivered with the audaspace source distribution.

The demos/ folder in the root folder of the source tree contains simple demo applications that show the functionality of audaspace.

Tutorials
=========

audaplay
--------

This demo application is a simple audio file player that accepts a single filename as a parameter. The target of this tutorial is to teach basic library principles and specifically device setup and audio file playback. The sample uses quite some C++11 features which are expected to be known, such as lambda functions and condition variables.

signalgen
---------

The signalgen application stores different signals in audio files. Apart from sounds read from files, sounds can also be generated from several basic signal generators such as @ref Sine or @ref Triangle waves. This tutorial shows how those signals can be generated and also how audio files can be written using an @ref IWriter.

Outlook
-------

Capabilities not covered in the tutorials include:

- 3D Audio
- Buffering
- Effects and Filters
- Sequencing
- Readers
- Audio Stream Specification (Channels, Sample Rate and Sample Format)
- Plugin Development

Other Demos
===========

audaconvert
-----------

Merging the abilities to read from sound files and write new ones audaconvert converts an audio file from one to another audio format.

audaremap
---------

The audaremap program expects an input file and the amount of desired output channels as parameters and shows the resulting default channel mapping that would be done by audaspace.

openaldevices
-------------

This demo application directly uses the OpenAL plugin to list all available OpenAL devices.
